- After search, when I go back, for some reason, the site breaks...why? componentWillUnmount issue??
- On the first search, it fetches all the workspaces...why?
- Style up workspace show page
- Restaurant distances
- Include jQuery plugin for rating system
- Add numbers to the markers
- Integrate who wrote the reviews / users. Image.includes(:user)??
- Figure out how to use polymorphic association so that we don't have to be inefficient with all the images in our app.
